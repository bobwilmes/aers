**ARRL Amateur Radio Emergency Service Mobile App**

# Background
The aers mobile application was written in [DART](https://dart.dev/) using the 
[flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework to allow use during natural disasters 
and emergencies to support emergency communications using [Ham Radio](http://www.arrl.org/what-is-ham-radio).

The vision is a mobile device such as an iPhone or Android smart phone or
tablet with a browser can collect information in forms at a field location
including GPS address and potentially photos and transmit the data using
HF radios with digital data. The FCC allows digital communications for
emergency services using low data rate of 300 baud, but occasionally allows
for higher data rates, such as that granted for [Hurricane Ida]
(https://www.arrl.org/news/fcc-grants-temporary-waiver-to-permit-higher-symbol-rate-data-transmissions-for-hurricane-ida-traffi).
